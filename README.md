## Functions
Cynosure provides comprehensive tools for various types of security assessments:
- Wireless Testing: Conduct in-depth Wi-Fi network analysis, including WPA/WPA2 cracking, rogue access point detection, and wireless traffic monitoring
- Network Penetration: Perform advanced network scanning, service identification, vulnerability assessment, and exploit execution
- Web Application Testing: Analyze web applications for SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and other OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities using integrated tools
- Password Auditing: Utilize powerful password cracking utilities and dictionary attack capabilities
- Forensic Analysis: Capture and analyze system artifacts, network traffic, and storage media contents
- Social Engineering: Develop targeted phishing campaigns and assess human factor security weaknesses

## Alternatives
While Cynosure aims to provide a unified experience across multiple platforms, there are other notable projects in the penetration testing space:

### Linux-Based Distributions
- [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) - Developed by Offensive Security  
  The de facto standard for penetration testing with a vast collection of tools

- [Parrot Security OS](https://www.parrotsec.org/) - Developed by Frozenbox  
  A privacy-focused distribution offering extensive security tools

- [BlackArch](https://blackarch.org/) - Developed by BlackArch Team  
  An Arch-based distribution with thousands of security tools

### Mobile Platforms
- [Kali NetHunter](https://www.kali.org/docs/nethunter-pro/) - Developed by Offensive Security  
  Official Kali Linux port for Android devices

- [cSploit](https://github.com/cSploit/android) - Developed by @pahapoika  
  The most complete and advanced IT security professional toolkit on Android

- [Andrax](https://andrax.thecrackertechnology.com/) - Developed by The Cracker Technology  
  A comprehensive solution for pentesting on android version 5 and above
  
- [Stryker](https://strykerdefence.com) - Developed by Stryker Defense
  Pentest workspace in your smartphone

Note: While these alternatives offer excellent functionality within their respective domains, Cynosure uniquely combines their strengths into a single cross-platform solution.

## Release Cycle and Code Availability

Our development process follows a structured release cycle designed to ensure maximum stability and security for our users:

1. **Development Phase**  
   Each new version begins with an intensive development period where major features and improvements are implemented.

2. **Closed Beta Testing**  
   Before public release, the new version undergoes rigorous closed beta testing by trusted community members and professional testers. This ensures all critical issues are identified and resolved.

3. **Public Release**  
   Once beta testing is complete and feedback has been incorporated, we release stable builds for all supported platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS, Android).

4. **Maintenance Period**  
   Between major releases, we provide minor updates and bug fixes to enhance performance and address any emerging issues.

5. **Code Disclosure Policy**  
   To balance transparency with security, we release the source code for each version only after its successor enters the public release stage. This approach allows us to:
   - Ensure users have access to fully tested and stable versions
   - Provide time for community feedback integration before making code publicly available
   - Maintain high security standards by delaying potential exploit development
   
This disciplined approach ensures that Cynosure remains a robust, reliable, and secure tool for ethical hackers while maintaining active community engagement throughout the development process.
